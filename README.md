## Description
Now here is how the pizza parlor website works .The customer puts in the type of pizza that they wanted from the provided variety.This includes the pizza size,the type of pizza one wants(there's pizza available for vegeterians too) the type of topping as well as the type of crust one wants too.
After doing this the java part of the website calculates the total sum of the order placed and gives back the total price of the placed order for the customer to see and decide whether they still want to place the order.
If the customer decides they still want to place the order after all, there's a submit button below which they click and a message is sent to them thanking them for placing the order and that their pizza order is on the way.
